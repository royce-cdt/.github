Right now, society faces huge, urgent challenges. From the imperative to achieve net-zero, to the need to build a resilient, circular economy in an uncertain world, to the drive for increased productivity as fellow nations embrace the digital revolution. To tackle these challenges, we need new materials and new materials systems, and we need them fast. But it can take 20 years to develop a new material with current methods. We need to innovate faster, as the pace of global change accelerates.

We are seeking scientists and engineers keen to acquire new skills and work in new ways, to help us realise the potential of the digital and data revolutions in materials science. This is Materials 4.0.
